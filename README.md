# Medical Practice Data System & Dashboard

A data system prototype for a family medical practice to track patient visits, payments, prescriptions, and send automated notifications.

## 🏥 Tools & Technologies
- Excel
- Power BI
- (Planned: Power Automate, SharePoint)

## 📋 Project Overview
The clinic previously used manual tracking for appointments and payments. I designed a prototype that organizes patient data, tracks financials, and lays the foundation for automation and reporting.

## ✅ Key Features
- Patient visit and medication tracking
- Revenue breakdown by payment method (cash, EFT, medical aid)
- Follow-up and vaccine reminders
- Planned automation using Power Automate

## 📂 Files
- `PatientDataTemplate.xlsx` – Sample data structure
- `ClinicDashboard.pbix` – Power BI visualization (optional preview)
- `case-study.md` – In-depth case study document

## 📈 Outcomes
- Improved record-keeping and patient tracking
- Centralized reporting for better decision-making
- Future-ready system for healthcare operations
